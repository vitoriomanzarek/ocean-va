We've lived your world: the panic of renewal season backlogs, the 2pm COI emergency, the carrier portal that logs you out mid-endorsement, and the client who doesn't understand why their premium went up.",
            benefit: "We understand your pain points because we've lived them—from renewal chaos to COI emergencies to E&O anxiety."

            body: 'Unlike competitors who recruit anyone and spend weeks teaching them what a COI is, we hire VAs who already have insurance operations experience. No 30-60 day ramp-up time wasted on basic concepts. Your VA understands endorsements, loss runs, and mortgagee changes from day one.',
            benefit: 'No training delays. Your VA is productive immediately because they come with insurance knowledge, not a blank slate.'

They understand the difference between an endorsement and a rewrite, and why COIs have SLAs measured in hours, not days.",
            benefit: 'Your VA knows insurance operations, not just general admin. They speak your language and understand your urgency.'

            Walker Insurance has managed over $100M in premiums across 30 years in Florida's 
            toughest market. We've lived the same pressures you face—rate hikes, carrier exits, 
            retention battles, and margin compression.

            Ocean VA was born from that experience. We know what works because we've done it 
            ourselves—and we're helping agencies across the country do the same.
