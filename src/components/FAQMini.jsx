      question: 'How fast can we start? Can I really launch in 2-3 days?',
      answer: 'Yes! Our streamlined process allows most agencies to go live within 2-3 days.\n\nDay 0: Share your needs in a 15-min call.\nDay 1: We match you with pre-vetted candidates.\nDay 2: Interview 2-3 qualified VAs.\nDay 3: Your chosen VA starts working.'
    },
    {
      question: 'What\'s included in the $1,300 monthly price?',

    },
    {
      question: 'Are there any setup fees or hidden costs?',

    },
    {
      question: 'What if my VA doesn\'t work out?',
      answer: 'We offer a no-cost replacement guarantee. If your VA isn\'t the right fit, we\'ll find you a replacement at no additional charge.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Do you offer bilingual support?',

    },
    {
      question: 'Will I work with the same dedicated VA?',
      answer: 'Yesâ€”you get one dedicated VA who learns your business, systems, and workflow. We never pool your work across a ticket queue.'
    },

    {
      question: 'Do you require long-term contracts?',
      answer: 'No. Everything is month-to-month with no lock-in or long-term contracts. Cancel anytime if you\'re not satisfied.'
    },
    {
      question: 'How are your VAs vetted and trained?',
      answer: 'We hire the top 1% of candidates through multi-stage screening, voice/tone assessments, and scenario testing. Each VA receives 30 days of specialized training before working with you.'
