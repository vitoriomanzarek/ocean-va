## 📝 Code Example

Here's a complete example of how the updated HeroPlaceholder component usage looks:

```jsx
<HeroPlaceholder 
  title="Real Estate VA Hero Image"
  description="Professional real estate agents/team working with property listings, showing productivity and teamwork in real estate context. (1200x800px recommended)"
  imageSrc="/images/industries/real-estate-va-hero.webp"
  imageAlt="Real Estate Virtual Assistant team collaborating on property deals"
/>
```

### Component Props:
- **title** (string, required): Title shown in placeholder (when no image)
- **description** (string, required): Description shown in placeholder (when no image)
- **imageSrc** (string, optional): Path to WebP image. If provided, displays image instead of placeholder
- **imageAlt** (string, optional): Alt text for accessibility. Falls back to title if not provided

// Mapping of pages to image paths
const imageMapping = {
  'RealEstateVA.jsx': '/images/industries/real-estate-va-hero.webp',
  'MedicalVA.jsx': '/images/industries/medical-va-hero.webp',
  'SmallBusinessVA.jsx': '/images/industries/small-business-va-hero.webp',
  'MarketingVA.jsx': '/images/industries/marketing-va-hero.webp',

## 📊 Image Optimization Tips

### File Size Optimization
- WebP format provides excellent compression
- Target: 500KB-1.5MB per image (already optimized)
- Maintain quality at 1200x800px

### Web Performance
- Images will be served from `/public/` (static assets)
- Consider lazy loading for below-fold images
- Use responsive image techniques if needed

### Accessibility
- Always provide descriptive alt text
- Alt text should describe the image content
- Example: "Real Estate Virtual Assistant team collaborating on property deals"

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Images Not Displaying
1. Verify file paths are correct (case-sensitive)
2. Check that files exist in correct directories
3. Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete or Cmd+Shift+Delete)
4. Check browser console for 404 errors

### Images Look Blurry
1. Verify image dimensions are 1200x800px
2. Check that image isn't scaled up beyond original size
3. Verify PNG quality is high enough

### Performance Issues
1. Optimize PNG file sizes (<500KB each)
2. Use image compression tools
3. Consider lazy loading if needed
